# vercel-pw-protection

This plugin overwrites your `vercel.json`'s `routes` attribute so that your deployment is password protected.

Login on demo: <https://mkdocs-vercel-pw-plugin.vercel.app/#TÃ¤ÃŸtðŸ˜€Emoji>

This plugin is an implementation of the cookie method from `https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-vercel-basic-auth-example`.

Prerequesites:
You have created a `vercel.json` file and it does not have any existing `routes`.

## Usage

Install the package via pip:
```bash
pip install mkdocs-vercel-pw-plugin
```

Then add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:
```yaml
plugins:
- search
- vercel_pw:
    cookie_name: JSESSIONID
    password: TÃ¤ÃŸtðŸ˜€Emoji
    restrict_to_domain: mkdocs-vercel-pw-plugin.vercel.app
    vercel_json_path: ../vercel.json
```

Optional:
You can link to `/logout.html`.

You need to run a successful build (`mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve`) after changing the config before pushing your changes to Vercel.
This is because the `vercel.json` is only updated after a build is performed.

### Password in environment variable

If you want to obscure the password a little bit, you can use an [environment variable](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#environment-variables) instead of the plain password in the `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
- search
- vercel_pw:
    cookie_name: JSESSIONID
    password: !ENV MKDOCS_VERCEL_PW_DEMO_APP
    restrict_to_domain: mkdocs-vercel-pw-plugin.vercel.app
    vercel_json_path: ../vercel.json
```

You can the set and export the environment variable or pass it directly to mkdocs:
```bash
MKDOCS_VERCEL_PW_DEMO_APP=TÃ¤ÃŸtðŸ˜€Emoji mkdocs serve
```

In this case, anyone with access to the source code can still access your site using the value in the `vercel.json` file, and they can also hex-decode that value to get your original password.
If you use an environment variable, you also need to set it in the CI/CD pipeline, otherwise this plugin will abort the build, since the missing `password` parameter is not set.

But I am not sure if you need the same password there, since I would guess that the `vercel.json` file is fully read and processed, before its values like `buildCommand` are executed. Thus any modifications that the plugin does should theoretically not affect the deployed site. But I havent tested that.

## Customization

By default the "login" page mimics the Vercel deployment not found page.
This serves as a small security by obscurity measure.
Of course you can also provide your own `docs/deployment_not_found.html` that instead shows a login form or something like that.

## Notable changes

### Head

- Perform basic sanity checks on password.


### Version 0.1.0

- Use hex encoding instead of base64.
    The issue is that vercel's header matching is case insensitive, which makes password brute forcing much easier.
    For example if the password was `aa` (`YWE=`), the password `c` (`YwE=`) would also be accepted.
    The new encoding should also accept Unicode characters like Umlauts, emojis, etc.
    But I would recommend sticking to ASCII, since Unicode is tricky and I am not sure if JavaScript and Python handle encoding exactly the same.

### Version 0.0.2

- Hide the `Plugin 'vercel_pw' was specified multiple times` warning
